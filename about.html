            <br>
            <p>
                First: Building a political system based on unity, common struggle, democracy and the rule of law
                Building a Palestinian political system requires a comprehensive national vision. To achieve this, the
                “Future” list adopts the following priorities:
            </p>
            <p>
                Ending the division and addressing its destructive effects, as a necessity to restore .1 national unity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reconsidering the legal, political and functional foundations of our political system, and .2
                addressing the structural imbalances and problems it suffers from in the PLO's
                relationship with the national authority.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reform the Liberation Organization on national, militant, institutional and .3 representative bases, in
                order to restore its role as a national liberation movement, as the only legitimate representative of
                our people.
            </p>
            <p>
                The resistance in all its forms is a legitimate law for our Palestinian people, and .4 consensus on a
                national and struggle strategy is a necessity to face challenges, end the occupation, and recover our
                rights.
            </p>
            <p>
                Building real partnerships that support our people's struggle for liberation and the .5 establishment of
                an independent Palestinian state with full sovereignty with Jerusalem as its capital.
            </p>
            <p>
                Establishing the pillars of collective leadership at the national level, instead of .6
                exclusivity and totalitarian rule.
            </p>
            <p>
                Consolidation of the pillars of a democratic system, its foundations are periodic and fair .7 elections,
                the peaceful rotation of power, the separation of powers, the rule of law, media freedom, and the fight
                against corruption.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rebuilding the government work system and the public job on a national and unitary .8 basis.

                dependency on the occupying countries, which is based on the limitations and restrictions of the “Oslo”
                agreements and the “Paris” economic protocol.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will legislate that protects the capabilities and resources of the Palestinian people .2, ensures the

            </p>
            <p>
                Formulate development policies that allow donor countries' aid to be directed from relief .7 operations
